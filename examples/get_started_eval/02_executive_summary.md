# Documentation Evaluation - Executive Summary

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Project:** SnowCLI Tools
**Overall Rating:** 6.5/10

---

## Top 3 Critical Issues

### 1. Version Number Chaos (Priority: CRITICAL)
**Impact:** Users cannot determine what version they're using or what features are available.

**Found:**
- pyproject.toml: v1.9.0
- README header: v1.7.0
- README footer: v1.5.0
- Getting started: v1.5.0
- API docs: v1.8.0
- Current branch: v1.10.0_discovery_assistant

**Fix:** 30-minute global find/replace to sync all docs to v1.9.0

### 2. Missing Core Documentation (Priority: CRITICAL)
**Impact:** 8 broken links to essential documentation.

**Missing Files Referenced:**
- `docs/configuration.md` (referenced 4+ times)
- `docs/api-reference.md`
- `docs/mcp-integration.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`

**Fix:** 4 hours to create or redirect these files

### 3. Installation Path Confusion (Priority: HIGH)
**Impact:** New users don't know if this is a published package or development-only.

**Conflicting Guidance:**
- README: "pip install snowcli-tools" (implies published)
- Getting Started: "Or install from PyPI (when published)" (implies not published)
- Getting Started: "git clone... uv sync" (implies dev-only)

**Fix:** 1 hour to clarify user vs developer installation paths

## What's Working Well

1. **MCP Documentation** (8/10)
   - Excellent user guide with real conversation examples
   - Clear tool documentation
   - Multiple client configurations

2. **Profile Troubleshooting** (9/10)
   - Comprehensive error-to-solution mapping
   - Clear diagnostic steps
   - Security best practices

3. **Architecture Documentation** (9/10)
   - Clear layering diagrams
   - Well-explained service patterns
   - Good extension points

---

## Quick Wins (Est. 2 hours)

1. **Fix version references** - Global replace to v1.9.0 (30 min)
2. **Add repository URL** - Replace `<repository-url>` placeholder (5 min)
3. **Create configuration.md** - Basic structure with TODOs (1 hour)
4. **Fix broken links** - Update or redirect (30 min)

---

## Recommended Action Plan

### Week 1: Foundation (Est. 6 hours)
- Fix all version inconsistencies
- Create or redirect missing core documentation
- Fix all broken links
- Remove duplicate files

### Week 2: Getting Started (Est. 6 hours)
- Separate user vs developer installation
- Create end-to-end authentication guide
- Add success indicators to all steps
- Create 5-minute quick-win tutorial

### Week 3: Balance Documentation (Est. 8 hours)
- Create CLI reference (matching MCP quality)
- Complete missing tool documentation
- Add automation guide
- Create error catalog

---

## Key Recommendations

1. **Use MCP docs as template** - The MCP documentation quality should be the standard for all docs
2. **Fix foundation first** - Don't add new docs until version/links are fixed
3. **Test with real users** - Have 3 new users try getting started, observe friction points
4. **Create documentation index** - Central guide to all documentation

---

## User Impact Assessment

**Data Analyst (exploring data):**
- Can probably succeed with MCP (good docs)
- Will struggle with CLI setup (unclear instructions)
- May give up during installation (conflicting guidance)

**Data Engineer (automation):**
- Can figure out CLI from examples
- Blocked on configuration (docs missing)
- No automation guide available

**AI Engineer (MCP integration):**
- Excellent experience (comprehensive MCP docs)
- Some tools undocumented
- Generally well-supported

---

## Bottom Line

Strong technical foundation with excellent MCP documentation, undermined by critical version inconsistencies and broken links. Investment of 2-3 days will transform this from confusing to exemplary.

**Immediate Next Step:** Fix version references across all documentation (30 minutes) to stop the bleeding.
