## üîç Key Insights

### What Makes Good Documentation (from this evaluation)

The **docs/mcp/mcp_server_user_guide.md** is the gold standard in this project:
- Clear structure: What ‚Üí Quick Start ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Config ‚Üí Examples
- Real-world examples (conversation flows)
- Comprehensive use cases
- Good troubleshooting

**Recommendation:** Use this structure for all new documentation.

### Common Documentation Anti-Patterns Found

1. **Version Drift:** Docs reference different versions in different places
2. **Optimistic Links:** Link to docs before creating them
3. **Installation Ambiguity:** Unclear if production-ready or dev-only
4. **Missing Success Indicators:** No "expected output" examples
5. **Duplicate Files:** Same content in multiple locations
