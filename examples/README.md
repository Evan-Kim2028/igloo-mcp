# Igloo MCP Examples

This folder contains small, focused examples that complement the main documentation.

- Catalog examples: see `docs/examples/catalog-examples.md` for step-by-step catalog and search flows.
- Dependency graph demo: `examples/run_depgraph.py` shows how to build and inspect dependency graphs.
- Reporting bundle sample: `examples/reports/flash_crash_report.yaml` is a template input for the `igloo-report` CLI.

For a high-level overview, start with `docs/getting-started.md` or `docs/index.md` and then explore these examples as needed.
